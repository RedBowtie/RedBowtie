### Hi, there 👋

I am Jiacheng, currently a research assistant at FAST Lab. My bachelor major is automation. I'm interested in developing control strategies for robot locomotion. I'm also interested in multi-agent systems, optimal control and RL for robots. I wish to enable humanoids and quadruped to cooperate with humans in complex environments.

### 🏃🏻 Recent news:

- Working on paper for IROS
- Still searching for a way to design a high performance controller for inverted CubeTrack.
- Some plan for RL study.
