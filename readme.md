### Hi, there 👋

I am Jiacheng, and I ended my RA at FAST Lab. My bachelor major is automation. I'm interested in developing control strategies for robot locomotion. I'm also interested in multi-agent systems, optimal control and RL for robots. I wish to enable robots to cooperate with humans in complex environments.

### 🏃🏻 Recent news:

- Learning manipulation of robotic arms.
- Some plan for RL study.
- Preparing my MS study.
