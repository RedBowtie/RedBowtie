### Hi, there 👋

I am Jiacheng, a graduate at Johns Hopkins Robotics program. You can also call me Edzel. My bachelor major is automation and I was a RA in FAST Lab between 2023-2034. I'm interested in developing control strategies for robot locomotion. I'm also interested in multi-agent systems, optimal control and RL for robots. I wish to enable robots to cooperate with humans in complex environments.
